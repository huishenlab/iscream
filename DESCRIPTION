Description: BED files store ranged genomic data that can be queried even when
             the files are compressed. iscream can query data from BED files and return them
             in muliple formats: parsed records or their summary statistics as data frames
             or GenomicRanges objects, and matrices as matrix, GenomicRanges, or
             SummarizedExperiment objects. iscream also provides specialized
             support for importing methylation data.
