Test files
----------
The following datasets were created manually as dummy BED files for examples
and testing. They were compressed with bgzip and tab-indexed with tabix.

- a.bed.gz, a.bed.gz.tbi
- b.bed.gz  b.bed.gz.tbi
- c.bed.gz  c.bed.gz.tbi
- d.bed.gz  d.bed.gz.tbi
- biscuit_mergecg.bed.gz, biscuit_mergecg.bed.gz.tbi
- no_tabix.bed.gz
- all *.test files
- test_chroms/*

snmC-seq2 data
--------------
The following BED files were created using the snmC-seq2 dataset from

Luo, Chongyuan, Angeline Rivkin, Jingtian Zhou, Justin P. Sandoval, Laurie
Kurihara, Jacinta Lucero, Rosa Castanon, et al. 2018. “Robust Single-Cell DNA
Methylome Profiling with snmC-seq2.” Nat Commun 9 (1): 3824.
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-06355-2.

They correspond to SRR6911624, SRR6911625, SRR6911626, and SRR6911627 from
which the first and last 25 lines were extracted, compressed and tabixed.

- cell1.bed.gz, cell1.bed.gz.tbi
- cell2.bed.gz, cell2.bed.gz.tbi
- cell3.bed.gz, cell3.bed.gz.tbi
- cell4.bed.gz, cell4.bed.gz.tbi

htslib benchmarking dataset
---------------------------

htslib.csv was generated by timing iscream::make_mat on an unpublished BED file
dataset from our lab using htslib from Rhtslib and htslib compiled with and
without libdeflate.
